# MART-441-Homework2
This week I created a page that displays some favorite things about me that I Thought would be fun to try in code.
I was able to follow the tutorials on how to create this work and the flow it takes, turns out it was way longer than I anticipated, the work however was very new to me so that is why I took a lot of extra time to get better. I was proud with what I created even though the style isnt anything crazy. I than used chatgbt just see what it would create and it literally coded the whole page in sceonds. I liked how fast the work was done and I kind of compared the work and some difference were just making it more personal. As in the webpage was what I asked but it was very bland and had no real style. Even though the work generated is what I asked, I feel like expalining the code is much more difficult. Almost like trying to put a puzzle together. I still feel like it is my own work due to me asking a computer to do it for me. But I understand why it is such a big argument.
